# Digital-Time-Capsule-for-Secure-Data-Storage
Developed a blockchain-based Digital Time Capsule system using Ethereum smart contracts, Web3.js, and IPFS to
enable secure, time-locked data storage with decentralized access control.

Implemented AES-256 encryption, tamper-proof smart contracts, and Layer-2 scaling to enhance security and reduce
transaction costs, achieving successful deployment and testing on Ganache.
